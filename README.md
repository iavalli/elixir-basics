I didn't create a fork of the original code, because the best way to follow the course is to type everything by yourself.
I also hope to add some comments and maybe some info from other learning sources which will be listed below (later on).

WHY ELIXIR?

web2 and web3 stack have the same (JS frameworks based) frontend stack
fullstack devs have more chances to be hired.
But the frontend, Javascript, its frameworks, libraries, plus HTML and CSS are not my cup of tea.
Too many different things and they are being changed too fast, and every company uses another framework, etc.

My idea is that a great app is business logic, data and system design first. I don't want to put so much time and effort in the frontend.
IMHO, CLI has the best UI. No UI is the best UI. Dark theme, performs well and really does what it was designed for - that's enough (for me).
As someone who once spent 4 hours choosing a shade for the background of my first web page, since then I prefer to keep away from the frontend stuff.
There are many people who are way better at that than I am. But I NEED to create at least SOMETHING on the frontend to present the backend.

My goal was and still is to master quick fullstack MVP development and scalable web apps. I thought that there should be a better way to make things work.
Luckily, a lot of devs had this idea many years before me, and some of them have created great technologies and tools for this purpose.

Elixir is mostly used and loved by Senior devs who already know and have worked with an awful lot of different programming languages.
It's a rare choice to be a first programming language for someone. Old and humble enough to believe elder and more experienced folks, 
why would I go through 5-10 years of working with different languages and frameworks,
as the market and fashion shifts from one stack to another, while I can jump directly to Elixir?

I didn't find any persuasive answer to this. Instead, I found a lot of great videos like these ones:

All the reviews from Elixir forums and comment sections said that working with Elixir, LiveView & Phoenix was life-changing, enjoyable.. 
Stackoverflow stats didn't lie.
So, I fell in love with the idea of creating a fullstack web app with the single language and without digging into the current frontend hell.
With millions of users, easily scaled, designed to be reliable, distributed, concurrent, etc, etc, etc. What could be better?

That is my WHY. I am starting this way with the hope to find later some great startup founders and help them turn their ideas into working MVPs and apps.
Then get invested, scale easily and stay a small agile team with a growing audience. Saving time, money and energy for everyone.

Let's go with me.
