# elixir-basics
If you have an MVP idea and wish it'd be developed in Elixir, 
feel free to contact me in any way, and we'll try to cooperate for this purpose.

The code is based on the free Elixir course(RU) produced by Ilya Krukowski: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWlFXymvoaJ_SWXOOm2JSqv86ZBkQ9-zo

Ilya's code and Github:
https://github.com/bodrovis-learning/Elixir-YT-Series/tree/master

Content by lessons:
1. Intro, data types and functional programming
2. Pattern matching
3. Modules, functions, r, margin conditions
4. Recursion, list, head, tail, tail optimization
5. Lambda, higher order functions, Matrix style output
6. Branching, errors, data structures, kw lists
7. Processes, monitors, spawn, spawn)link, practice
8. Long running server processes
9. Transfers, enum, stream, list inclusions
10. OTP, GenServer, callbacks, mix, game of stones
11. Protocols, polymorphism
12. Metaprogramming, macroses, quote/unqoute, dinamic connection, AST

Why not a fork of the original code? Because the best way to follow the course is to experiment in CLI or IDE.

Try it by yourself:
https://elixir-lang.org/install.html - install Elixir
https://www.erlang.org/downloads - install Erlang/OTP (if it didn't come with the Elixir installation)

VSCode: install ElixirLS extension, create "filename.ex" or "filename.exs" file
In CLI: $ iex   (double Ctrl+C to quit)

The course is recorded in RU, but here everything is in EN.
I add comments and some info from other learning sources (listed below).

WHY ELIXIR?
- most loved and highly paid prog lang
- mostly used by Senior devs with many years of experience (Stackoverflow research 2023).
- I believe in standing on giants' shoulders
- Elixir boosts developers' productivity
- saves time and money for a business

This repo will cover basics of:
PETAL stack (Phoenix, Elixir, TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, LiveView) - focused on BE
And maybe:
Ecto (for DBs)
ExUnit (for testing)
Ash
Absinthe (for GraphQL)
some libs for blockchain/AI/ML

Related pets will be listed below as github links.
Note for comparisons: my first lang is Python.
